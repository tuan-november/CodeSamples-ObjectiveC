Description: This featured program compresses and encodes a string of characters into a series of 0s and 1s. 
It can also decompresses and decodes a series of 0s and 1s back to the original characters. 
The compression demonstrates the Huffman's Encoding Algorithm. 
The more frequently a character is used in the string, the more space-efficient the algorithm is.
